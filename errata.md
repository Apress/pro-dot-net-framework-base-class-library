# Errata for *Book Title*

On **page 2** [text correction]:
 
The text highlighted in bold in the below line in Chapter 1:

“For example, **about the types in the CLR are available application and choose the** string **reference type**, we are using one of the fundamental types available through the Base Class Library (BCL), which is the foundational library that is part of the CLI specification that is implemented by the .NET Framework and .NET Core (and is the main reason for the existence of the .NET Standard).”

Has been replaced with:

“For example, **when we are developing some application and chooses the** string **reference type**, we are using one of the fundamental types available through the Base Class Library (BCL), which is the foundational library that is part of the CLI specification that is implemented by the .NET Framework and .NET Core (and is the main reason for the existence of the .NET Standard).”
